# now since git review is merged with tasks let's remove /git route

## Problem Statement
Git review functionality merged into Tasks page (TaskReviewPanel). Standalone /git route now redundant - causes nav duplication, maintenance overhead.

## Scope
**In:**
- Remove /git route file
- Remove nav link from sidebar
- Keep git tRPC router (used by TaskReviewPanel)
- Keep @/components/git components (reused by TaskReviewPanel)

**Out:**
- Not removing git components (still needed)
- Not removing git tRPC endpoints (still in use)
- Not touching TaskReviewPanel implementation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase: Remove Route
- [x] Delete `src/routes/git.tsx`
- [x] Remove nav link from `src/routes/__root.tsx:168`
- [x] Verify `src/routeTree.gen.ts` regenerates without /git route (auto-generated by TanStack Router)
- [x] Verify TaskReviewPanel still works (uses @/components/git)

## Key Files
- `src/routes/git.tsx` - delete entire file
- `src/routes/__root.tsx:168` - remove `<NavLink to="/git">` line
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` - auto-regenerated by TanStack Router
- `src/components/git/*` - keep (reused by TaskReviewPanel)
- `src/trpc/git.ts` - keep (endpoints still needed)

## Success Criteria
- [x] /git route inaccessible
- [x] Git nav link removed from sidebar
- [x] TaskReviewPanel still renders diffs/commits
- [x] No TypeScript errors

## Completion Notes
- Removed `/git` route file (`src/routes/git.tsx`)
- Removed Git nav link from sidebar (`src/routes/__root.tsx:168`)
- Removed unused `GitBranch` icon import
- Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Git components and tRPC endpoints remain intact for use by TaskReviewPanel
